# ♻️ Smart Bin & Sustainability App

This project combines a **smart bin with sensors** for automated waste sorting and a **mobile app** designed to educate users on sustainable practices. The solution enhances efficiency, reduces manual work, and raises environmental awareness — making waste management smarter and more eco-friendly. 🌍

---

## 📱 Overview

This innovative solution consists of:
- A **Smart Bin System** using sensors (e.g., weight, metal detection, moisture) to identify and sort waste automatically.
- A **Mobile Application** (Flutter-based) that:
  - Educates users about proper waste sorting.
  - Tracks personal and community recycling stats.
  - Provides sustainability tips and achievements.
